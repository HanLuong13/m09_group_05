**[Implementation: DBSCAN](Implementation_DBSCAN)**


For presentation slides on process, model performance, and comparison of models, refer to [Implementation-DBSCAN-Presentation.pdf.](Implementation_DBSCAN/Implementation-DBSCAN-Presentation.pdf).

For code sample of DBSCAN, K-means, and dimensionality-reducing models, accuracy scores, and full documented process, refer to [our Main Notebook.](Implementation_DBSCAN/Main_Notebook.ipynb)

For dataset from curriculum, refer to [k-means-animal-dataset.](Implementation_DBSCAN/2021-11-ml-09-k-means-animals-dataset.csv) This dataset was used for the majority of code sample.

For original Palmer Penguins dataset with full characteristics, including species, refer to [penguindata.csv.](Implementation_DBSCAN/penguindata.csv) This dataset was used for domain knowledge and accuracy scores.

**[Research: Random Forest](Research_Random_Forest)**


For research and appendix with links of resources, refer to ['Presentation with Appendix.pdf'.](Research_Random_Forest/Presentation%20with%20appendix.pdf) 

For code sample, refer to ['basic_random_forest_model.ipynb'.](Research_Random_Forest/basic_random_forest_model.ipynb)
